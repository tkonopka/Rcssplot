# Rcssplot

![Status](https://travis-ci.org/tkonopka/Rcssplot.svg?branch=master)



The Rcssplot package brings cascading style sheets to the R graphical 
environment. It provides a means to separate the aesthetics from 
data crunching in plots and charts.

See [http://www.rcssplot.org](http://www.rcssplot.org/tutorials/) and the [github wiki](http://github.com/tkonopka/Rcssplot/wiki) for documentation.
