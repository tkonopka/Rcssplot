# Rcssplot tests

The tests in this directory mainly test that commands finish successfully, i.e. without errors.

Some tests perform validations on output. However, validating graphics
is not straightforward. Thus, even when the tests finish without errors, it is important to ensure that the generated output is actually as expected.

To run individual tests:

source("01.parsing.R")
source("02.wrappers.R")
etc.

To run all tests

source("00.all.R")
